# Instructions

This directory contains the Sage scripts for prototyping Kyber.
The utility methods (e.g. `bits_to_bytes`, `compress` etc.) are contained in the `utils.sage` file, while PKE & KEM methods are in the `Kyber.sage` file. Parameters are defined in `main.sage`.


To run the scripts in SageMath directly, run:
```
sage main.sage
```

To run them via python, run the auto-generated python file with the python version that comes with sage:

```
sage -python main.py
```
